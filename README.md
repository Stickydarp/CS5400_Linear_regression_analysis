## Goal
Implement linear and ridge regression and test them on a dataset, then evaluate each model for its competency.

## Workflow
1. **Read in the data** from Excel file  
2. **Shuffle and divide** the data into training, validation, and test sets  
3. **Train the models**  
4. **Test the models** against the test data  
5. **Compare** results against scikit-learn
